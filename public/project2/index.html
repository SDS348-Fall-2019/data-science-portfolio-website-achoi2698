<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 11/24/2019. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .Rmd file to get better formatting. Notice that you can adjust the opts_chunk$set(…) above to set certain parameters if necessary to make the knitting cleaner (you can globally set the size of all plots, etc). I have gone ahead and set a few for you (such as disabling warnings and package-loading messges when knitting)!</p>
<p>Like before, I envision your written text forming something of a narrative structure around your code/output. All results presented must have corresponding code. Any answers/results/plots etc. given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be graded. Furthermore, all code contained in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. (Code which produces warnings is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean).</p>
</div>
<div id="find-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Find data:</h2>
<p>Find one dataset with at least 5 variables that wish to use to build model. At least one should be categorical (with 2-5 groups) and at least two should be numeric. Ideally, one of your variables will be binary (if not, you will need to create one by discretizing a numeric, which is workable but less than ideal). You will need a minimum of 40 observations (<em>at least</em> 10 observations for every explanatory variable you have, ideally 20+ observations/variable).</p>
<p>It is perfectly fine to use either dataset (or the merged dataset, or a subset of your variables) from Project 1. However, you could also diversify your portfolio a bit by choosing a different dataset to work with (particularly if the variables did not reveal interesting associations in Project 1). The only requirement/restriction is that you may not use data from any examples we have done in class or lab. It would be a good idea to pick more cohesive data this time around (i.e., variables that you actually thing might have a relationship you would want to test). Think more along the lines of your Biostats project.</p>
<p>Again, you can use data from anywhere you want (see bottom for resources)! If you want a quick way to see whether a built-in (R) dataset has binary and/or character (i.e., categorical) variables, check out this list: <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html" class="uri">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Guidelines and Rubrc</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>0. (5 pts)</strong> Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>#The data set melanoma contains measurements of patients who have been afflicted with melanoma. All 205 patients listed in this dataset have had their tumors removed from the period of 1962 to 1977. The variables included are time(survival time in days since the operations), status(1 means they died from melanoma, 2 means that were still alive, and 3 means that had passed away from unrelated reasons), sex(male or female), age(their age in years when they had the melanoma removed), year(the actual year of the operation), thickness(tumor thickness measured in mm) and ulcer(detection of an ulcer after tumor was removed. )</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. (15 pts)</strong> Perform a MANOVA testing whether any of your numeric variables (or a subset of them, if including them all doesn’t make sense) show a mean difference across levels of one of your categorical variables (3). If they do, perform univariate ANOVAs to find response(s) showing a mean difference across groups (3), and perform post-hoc t tests to find which groups differ (3). Discuss the number of tests you have performed, calculate the probability of at least one type I error (if unadjusted), and adjust the significance level accordingly (bonferroni correction) before discussing significant differences (3). Briefly discuss assumptions and whether or not they are likely to have been met (2).</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:It appears that there is a significant mean difference across the groups of the categorical status, based on one of my numeric variables. Alive &amp; death by melanoma, and alive &amp; unrelated deaths differs significantly across status based on time. Alive &amp; death, alive &amp; unrelated death, and melanoma death &amp; unrelated death differs significantly across status based on age. Alive &amp; death by melanoma differs significantly across status based on year. Alive &amp; death by melanoma differs significantly across status based on tumor thickness. Alive &amp; death by melanoma differs significantly across status based on time. The probability that at least a Type 1 error was made is 0.7226104. #The bonferroni adjusted significant level is 0.02890442. After the bonferroni correction, there is now no longer a significant difference between those who died from melanoma &amp; those who died from unrelated causes, based on AGE. The same can be said based on TUMOR THICKNESS and whether or not there was an ULCER. The shape of the lines and the distance between the lines indicates that the data has multivariate normality. Since the values between the groups are similar in value, this shows that the assumption for covariance was met.</p>

</ul>
<p>Answer: I am trying to see if tumor thickness has some sort of relationship with whether there was an ulcer or not, when the tumor was removed
Ho = mean tumor thickness when removed is the same for whether there was an ulcer vs no ulcer
Ha = mean tumor thickness when removed is different for whether there was an ulcer vs no ulcer
Null hypothesis is rejected, there is a difference between thickness and whether an ulcer was there or not. In addition, the p-value of 2.042e-09 if far less than that of 0.05 so this is another indicator that the null hypothesis was rejected.</p>

<li><p><strong>3. (35 pts)</strong> Build a linear regression model predicting one of your response variables from at least 2 other variables, including their interaction. Mean-center any numeric variables involved in the interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpret the coefficient estimates (do not discuss significance) (10)</li>
<li>Plot the regression using <code>ggplot()</code>. If your interaction is numeric by numeric, refer to code near the end of WS15 to make the plot. If you have 3 or more predictors, just chose two to plot for convenience. (7)</li>
<li>Check assumptions of linearity, normality, and homoskedasticity either graphically or using a hypothesis test (3)</li>
<li>Regardless, recompute regression results with robust standard errors via <code>coeftest(..., vcov=vcovHC(...))</code>. Discuss significance of results, including any changes from before/after robust SEs if applicable. (7)</li>
<li>What proportion of the variation in the outcome does your model explain? (3)
Answer:
The intercept value is 2171.872 which indicates the survival of the patient in days when age_c and thickness_c are controlled for and equal to 0. The estimate value is -17.506. Controlling for thickness_c by setting it equal to 0, there is a 17.506 decrease in days of survival after the operation for every increase in age_c in years. Controlling for age_c, there is a 55.816 decrease in days of survival after the operation for every 1mm increase in thickness_c. The interaction estimate is -1.828. This indicates that for every 1 year increase in age_c, the slope for thickness_c vs survival time in days decreases by 1.828. The assumption for linearity and homoskedacicity is met because the distribution between the top and bottom of the 0 mark of residuals is evenly spread. Normality - the graph appears to be normally distributed. It appears that robust standard errors for mean centered age, mean centered thickness and mean centered values for the interaction of thickness and age, were all larger than the unrobust standard errors. 0.1277 is the proportion of variation of time(days) explained by the overall model which includes all the predictors at the same time</li>

Answer:
It appears that the bootstrapped standard errors are higher than the original/unrobust standard errors but greater than the robust standard errors. The bootstrap SE for age_c, thickness_c and interaction between age_c &amp; thickness_c is higher than that of the original SE but lower than that of the robust SE. This means that the p-values are also in between that of the original and robust SE.</p>

<p>Answer: For every one mm increase in tumor thickness, the odds of having an ulcer are multiplied by 1.582095. The odds of having an ulcer increases by 58.21% for every additional mm increase in thickness. For every one year increase that passes, the odds of having an ulcer are multiplied by 1.025818. In other words, the odds of having an ulcer increases by 2.55% for every additional year that passes. Accuracy = 0.7463415 is the proportion of cases that were correctly classified. Sensitivity = 0.5666667 is the proportion of cases, where an ulcer was present, that were correctly predicted out of all the cases in which the ulcer was present. Specificity = 0.8869565 is the proportion of cases, where an ulcer was not present, that were correctly predicted out of all the cases in which the ulcer was not present. PPV = 0.796875 is the proportion of cases, where an ulcer was present, where the prediction was correctly identified as a patient having an ulcer, out of all cases where the test result indicated that there was an ulcer(test result positive)</p>

<li><strong>6. (10 pts)</strong> Choose one variable you want to predict (can be one you used from before; either binary or continuous) and run a LASSO regression inputting all the rest of your variables as predictors.

<li><p>However, you <em>emphatically DO NOT</em> have to use datasets available via R packages! In fact, I would much prefer it if you found the data from completely separate sources and brought them together (a much more realistic experience in the real world)! You can even reuse data from your SDS328M project, provided it shares a variable in common with other data which allows you to merge the two together (e.g., if you still had the timestamp, you could look up the weather that day: <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/" class="uri">https://www.wunderground.com/history/</a>). If you work in a research lab or have access to old data, you could potentially merge it with new data from your lab!</p></li>
<li><p>Here is a curated list of interesting datasets (read-only spreadsheet format): <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit" class="uri">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit</a></p></li>

This is the spurious correlations website, and it is fun, but if you look at the bottom of each plot you will see sources for the data. This is a good place to find very general data (or at least get a sense of where you can scrape data together from)!</p></li>
